== LDAP (HTTP Basic and Form Login)

Georchestra Gateway supports authentication and authorization against LDAP,
including Microsoft Active Directory.

Multiple LDAP authorization services can be configured, in which case, when
doing HTTP Basic auth and Form login, each **enabled** LDAP service will be
probed for the authentication credentials in the order they appear in the
configuration, and the first successful authentication will be used.

If no `georchestra.security.ldap.[name].enabled` is `true`, the log-in page won't
even show the username/password form inputs, and HTTP Basic authentication won't be
enabled.

At application startup, the enabled configurations are validated. The application
will fail to start if there's a validation error.

Each LDAP authentication provider can be one of:

* A **standard** LDAP provider, which provides provides basic authorization
credentials in the form of a list of role names.
* An **extended** LDAP provider, as traditionally used by geOrchestra's
internal OpenLDAP database, which enriches the authentication principal
object with additional user identity properties.
* An **Active Directory** LDAP provider, which provides basicauthorization
credentials in the form of a list of role names.

=== Configuration properties

LDAP Authentication is enabled and set up through the following
externalized configuration properties (usually from georchestra data
directory's `gateway/security.yaml`):

|===
|Property name | Default value | Description
|`georchestra.gateway.security.ldap.[name]`
|
|Name assigned to the configuration, under which to set up each specific LDAP provider.

|`georchestra.gateway.security.ldap.[name].enabled`
|`false`
|Whether the LDAP authentication provider is enabled. If `false` (default) it won't be taken into account at startup. If `true` and the configuration is invalid, the application won't be able to
start. The configuration can be invalid because a mandatory property is not set. Some properties
are optional or mandatory depending on whether the authentication provider is "standard", "extended",
or "Active Directory".

|`georchestra.gateway.security.ldap.[name].extended`
|`false`
|If `true`, then geOrchestra's extended LDAP properties will be extracted as part of the authentication
user principal, besides the authorization role names. These properties are usually configured to be sent back to backend services in `georchestra.gateway.default-headers.*` and/or
`georchestra.gateway.services.[service].headers.*` This property and `activeDirectory` are mutually
exclusive, both can't be `true`.

|`georchestra.gateway.security.ldap.[name].activeDirectory`
|`false`
|If `true`, the authentication provider is configured as an Active Directory service . This property and `extended` are mutually exclusive, both can't be `true`.

|`georchestra.gateway.security.ldap.[name].url`
|
|Mandatory. The LDAP URL, for example: `ldap://localhost:389`.

|`georchestra.gateway.security.ldap.[name].domain`
|
|The Active Directory domain, maybe empty, though most of the time you'll need to set the configured domain. Only relevant if `activeDirectory` is `true`.

|`georchestra.gateway.security.ldap.[name].baseDn`
|
|Base Distinguished Name of the LDAP directory.
Also named root or suffix, see http://www.zytrax.com/books/ldap/apd/index.html#base
For example, georchestra's default baseDn is `dc=georchestra,dc=org`

|`georchestra.gateway.security.ldap.[name].users.rdn`
|
|Mandatory except if `activeDirectory` is `true`, in which case it's ignored. Users RDN Relative
distinguished name of the "users" LDAP organization unit.E.g. if the complete name (or DN)
is `ou=users,dc=georchestra,dc=org`, the RDN is `ou=users`.

|`georchestra.gateway.security.ldap.[name].users.searchFilter`
|No default value for basic and extended LDAP. Defaults to `(&(objectClass=user)(userPrincipalName={0}))` for Active Directory.
|Optional if `activeDirectory` is `true`, mandatory otherwise. Users search filter,
e.g. `(uid={0})`.

|`georchestra.gateway.security.ldap.[name].users.returningAttributes`
|null
|Specifies the attributes that will be returned as part of the search. null indicates
that all attributes will be returned. An empty array indicates no attributes are returned.

|`georchestra.gateway.security.ldap.[name].roles.rdn`
|
|Ignored for Active Directory, mandatory otherwise. Relative Distinguished Name of the "roles" LDAP organization unit. E.g. if the complete name (or DN) is `ou=roles,dc=georchestra,dc=org`,
the RDN shall be `ou=roles`.

|`georchestra.gateway.security.ldap.[name].roles.searchFilter`
|
|Ignored for Active Directory, mandatory otherwise. Roles search filter. e.g. `(member={0})`.

|`georchestra.gateway.security.ldap.[name].orgs.rdn`
|
| Mandatory if `[name].extended` is `true`, ignored otherwise. Organizations search base.
For example: `ou=orgs`.
|===

=== Sample configuration

The usual geOrchestra OpenLDAP configuration is embedded in the application's
default configuration file, but disabled, to make it really easy to get started
with default settings, by just setting `georchestra.gateway.security.ldap.default.enabled=true`.

The following is a sample configuration encompassing three LDAP services, the `default` one,
another extended config named `ldap2`, and an Active Directory service named `activeDirSample`:

[source,yaml]
----
georchestra:
  gateway:
    security:
      ldap:
        default:
          enabled: true
        ldap2:
          enabled: false
          extended: true
          url: ${ldapScheme}://${ldapHost}:${ldapPort}
          baseDn: ${ldapBaseDn:dc=georchestra,dc=org}

          baseDn: dc=georchestra,dc=org
          users.searchFilter: (&(objectClass=user)(userPrincipalName={0}))
----


== OAuth2 & OpenID Connect

OAuth2 authentication is enabled by setting `georchestra.gateway.security.oauth2.enabled` to `true`.

=== Provider configuration

Identity providers are declared as shown in https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/oauth2/login/core.html[Spring OAuth2 Log In documentation].
Some providers are natively supported by Spring, resulting in minimal configuration which often summarizes
as defining `client-name`, `client-id` and `client-secret`, and `scope` as in the following example :
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        registration:
          google:
            client-name: <display-name>
            clientId: <client-id>
            clientSecret: <client-secret>
            scope: openid, email, profile
----

For providers compatible with OAuth2 or OpenID Connect but not natively supported, this section needs more
details which depends on the provider used, shown in this example but may vary :
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        registration:
          <provider-name>:
            client-name: <display-name>
            client-id: <client-id>
            client-secret: <client-secret>
            authorization-grant-type: authorization_code
            redirect-uri: https://<gateway-url>/login/oauth2/code/<provider-name>
            scope: openid, email, profile
----

Then an additional section is needed to define entry point URLs. With OpenID Connect, configuration can be
automatically loaded using the discovery endpoint if the provider has one, by adding
`spring.security.oauth2.provider.<provider-name>.issuer-uri: <configuration-entry-point-url>`
(without specifying the `.well-known/openid-configuration` part).

If the provider does not have this endpoint, configuration must be manually defined. An example is provided
below, but it may vary according to provider configuration :
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          <provider-name>:
            authorization-uri: <authorization-entry-point-url>
            token-uri: <token-entry-point-url>
            user-info-uri: <user-info-entry-point-url>
            end-session-uri: <end-session-entry-point-url>
            user-name-attribute: sub
----

The `authorization-uri`, `token-uri` and `user-info-uri` endpoints are always required, but other parameters
shown here may not, and other parameters not shown here may also be required. Please check
https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/oauth2/login/core.html#oauth2login-sample-application-config[Spring documentation]
about available parameters, and note that `end-session-uri` is not a Spring parameter but an addition that
was made to the gateway to add support for logout endpoint.

Identity providers may ask about authorized callback URLs so that they can check which client domain has
access to their identification feature with given secrets. Here are the callback URLs used by the gateway : +
Login callback : `https://<gateway-url>/login/oauth2/code/<provider-name>` +
Logout callback : `https://<gateway-url>/login?logout`

=== FranceConnect provider

FranceConnect is a widely used french identity provider which allows individuals to login on a public
administration website using an account held by another public administration. It is available only to
public entities, has some strict technical and ergonomics guidelines, and requires an administrative
validation procedure where functionality of the website is fully tested against theses guidelines
before providing production secrets. Until this procedure is complete, they provide integration secrets,
endpoints, and dummy accounts for testing purpose.

FranceConnect technical documentation is available https://partenaires.franceconnect.gouv.fr/fcp/fournisseur-service[here in French]. It requires some specific parameters to be used with the gateway. Here is an example of a working
configuration using integration platform (URLs may change) :

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        registration:
          <provider-name>:
            client-name: <display-name>
            clientId: <client-id>
            clientSecret: <client-secret>
            client-authentication-method: post
            authorization-grant-type: authorization_code
            redirect-uri: https://<gateway-url>/login/oauth2/code/<provider-name>
            scope: openid, email, given_name, family_name
        provider:
          <provider-name>:
            authorization-uri: https://fcp.integ01.dev-franceconnect.fr/api/v1/authorize
            token-uri: https://fcp.integ01.dev-franceconnect.fr/api/v1/token
            user-info-uri: https://fcp.integ01.dev-franceconnect.fr/api/v1/userinfo
            end-session-uri: https://fcp.integ01.dev-franceconnect.fr/api/v1/logout
            user-name-attribute: sub
----

`end-session-uri` is strictly mandatory because FranceConnect will keep track of active logins and won't
allow a new login if the previous one was not logged out properly by a call to this endpoint. If locked
when testing, login state can be reset by deleting FranceConnect cookies or by pasting this endpoint URL
in the locked browser.

FranceConnect does not support the general `profile` scope, so it is required to specify each necessary
OpenID fields one by one, as in the example, in a list of supported fields. It will also show to the user
when logging in which scope has been requested.

=== ProConnect provider

ProConnect enables private and public sector professionals to connect to their usual applications. It's like FranceConnect, but for professionals.

ProConnect overview and technical documentation is available https://github.com/numerique-gouv/proconnect-documentation[here in French]. It requires some specific parameters to be used with the gateway. Here is an example of a working
configuration using integration platform (URLs may change) :

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        registration:
          proconnect:
            provider: proconnect
            client-name: proconnect
            client-authentication-method: post
            client-id: <client-id>
            client-secret: <client-secret>
            authorization-grant-type: authorization_code
            redirect-uri: <redirect-url>
            scope: openid,siret,given_name,usual_name,email,uid,custom
        provider:
          proconnect:
            issuer-uri: https://fca.integ01.dev-agentconnect.fr/api/v2
----

You can replace `issuer-uri` by full configurations such as FranConnect.

[source,yaml]
----
        provider:
          proconnect:
            authorization-uri: https://fca.integ01.dev-agentconnect.fr/api/v2/authorize
            token-uri: https://fca.integ01.dev-agentconnect.fr/api/v2/token
            user-info-uri: https://fca.integ01.dev-agentconnect.fr/api/v2/userinfo
            end-session-uri: https://fca.integ01.dev-agentconnect.fr/api/v2/session/end
            jwk-set-uri: https://fca.integ01.dev-agentconnect.fr/api/v2/jwks
            user-name-attribute: sub
----

Note that ProConnect does not support the general `profile` scope, so it is required to specify each necessary
OpenID fields one by one. You can find the list of claims https://github.com/numerique-gouv/proconnect-documentation/blob/main/doc_fs/scope-claims.md#correspondance-entre-scope-et-claims-sur-proconnect[here].

=== Claims configuration

Both standard and non-standard claims can be used to set the `GeorchestraUser`'s
`organization` short name and `roles` properties using JSONPath expressions with
`OidcUser#getClaims():Map<String, Object>` as the expresion's root object.

> `org.springframework.security.oauth2.core.oidc.user.OidcUser`

|===
|Property name | Default value | Description
|`georchestra.gateway.security.oidc.claims.id.path`
|Defaults to the standard "sub" claim (subject identifier)
|JSONPath expression to extract the user identifier from the OIDC claims map

|`georchestra.gateway.security.oidc.claims.organization.path`
|
|JSONPath expression to extract the organization short name from the OIDC claims map

|`georchestra.gateway.security.oidc.claims.roles.json.path`
| 
|JSONPath expression to extract the user role names from the OIDC claims map

|`georchestra.gateway.security.oidc.claims.roles.uppercase`
| true
|Whether to return mapped role names as upper-case.

|`georchestra.gateway.security.oidc.claims.roles.normalize`
| true
|Whether to remove special characters and replace spaces by underscores.

|`georchestra.gateway.security.oidc.claims.roles.append`
| true
|Whether to append (`true`) the resolved role names to the roles given by the OAuth2 authentication, or replace them (`false`).
|===

=== Example

Take as example the following claims provided by an OIDC ID Token:

[source,json]
----
{
    "icuid": "abc123",
    "family_name": "Doe",
    "given_name": "John",
    "locale": "en-US",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "preferred_username": "jd@example.com",
    "sub": "...",
    "updated_at": 1490198843,
    "groups": [
        "GDI Planer",
        "GDI Editor (exten)"
    ],
    "PartyOrganisationID": "6007280321"
}
----

The following configuration properties can be used to extract the user id from the
`icuid` claim, the role names from the `groups` claim,
and the organization's short name from the `PartyOrganisationID` claim:

[source,yaml]
----
georchestra:
  gateway:
    security:
      oidc:
        # Configure mappings of custom IDToken claims to roles and org name
        claims:
          # JSONPath expression to extract the user id from a non-standard claim. Otherwise defaults to the "sub" claim (subject identifier)
          id.path: "$.icuid"
          # JSONPath expression to extract the organization identifier conveyed as
          # the sec-org request header to backend georchestra services
          organization.path: "$.PartyOrganisationID"
          roles:
              #  List of JSONPath expressions to extract additional role names
              # conveyed as the sec-roles request header to backend georchestra services.
              #  The ICU IDToken `PartyOrganisationID` attribute is converted to role `ORG_<orgid>`
              # and added first to the list due to a bug in Geofence that will only consider the
              # first role when resolving the user's data access rules.
              #  The "$.groups_json..['name']" JSONPath expression will extract all role names
              # from the IDToken's custom `groups_json` claim.
              #  For a sample IDToken containing the following properties:
              # 
              # {
              # "authorities": [
              #       {
              #         "authority": "ROLE_USER",
              #         "attributes": {
              #           "PartyOrganisationID": 6007280321, 
              #           "groups_json": [ [ {"name": "GDI Planer"}, {"name": "GDI Editor (extern)"} ] ]
              #         }
              #       }
              #  ]
              # }
              #
              # The resulting list of roles will be ["ORG_6007280321", "GDI_PLANER_EXTERN", "GDI_EDITOR_EXTERN"]
              # and the request header will be `sec-roles: ROLE_ORG_6007280321;ROLE_GDI_PLANER;ROLE_GDI_EDITOR_EXTERN;ROLE_USER`
              json.path:
              - "$.concat(\"ORG_\", $.PartyOrganisationID)"
              - "$.groups_json..['name']"
              uppercase: true
              normalize: true
              append: true
----

Resulting in the following property values for the `GeorchestraUser` instance associated to the request:

```
roles = ["ROLE_GDI_PLANER", "ROLE_GDI_EDITOR_EXTERN"]
organization = "6007280321"
```

Which the gateway will then convey to the proxied services as the following request headers:

```
sec-roles: ROLE_ORG_6007280321;ROLE_GDI_PLANER;ROLE_GDI_EDITOR;ROLE_USER
sec-org: 6007280321
```

== External authentication

Whenever an external authentication is used (OAuth2 or external IDP), a new attribute is added to Header, named :
```
sec-external-authentication
```
which is set to "true" in this case.

This allows the proxified webapps to adapt their behaviour consequently:
as an example, it does not make sense to display a password update form in the geOrchestra
console if the user is logged in via a third party identity provider. +
Having the flag passed in the HTTP headers allows to enable or disable such a functionality.

== Automatically creating users in a geOrchestra LDAP

As in the <<pre-authentication.adoc#,pre-authentication method>>, it is possible
to create externally authenticated users into a geOrchestra (extended) LDAP, so
that an administrator can promote the user to a higher role than `USER` by default.

In order to do so, you will need to set the following property, and make sure
an `extended` LDAP named `default` is defined, as in the following configuration
snippet:

```
georchestra:
  gateway:
    security:
      create-non-existing-users-in-l-d-a-p: true
      ldap:
        default:
          enabled: true
          extended: true
          [...]
```
